          <h3>Mechanics of Existence</h3>
          <p>"Mechanics of Existence" — Academic writing project. 
            Mechanics of Existence is a long-term independent writing and research project focused on systems-level thinking across physics, 
            neuroscience, and philosophy. The project explores how complex phenomena can be understood through shared structural principles, 
            with an emphasis on clarity, internal consistency, and first-principles reasoning rather than speculation.

            The work is conducted part-time alongside full-time employment and formal studies, and is intentionally structured as a slow, 
            long-horizon project. Current efforts are centered on literature review, conceptual mapping, and outlining core questions, with the 
            long-term goal of producing a coherent manuscript or paper once the framework is sufficiently mature.

            This project reflects a sustained interest in analytical problem-solving, structured thinking, and the ability to work independently on 
            complex ideas over extended periods of time.</p>

            <h3>Garden Fence</h3>
            <p>Designing and building a new garden fence - Needs to be painted and some more support to sustain the weight. 
              The project involves planning the layout, selecting materials, and constructing the fence to enhance the garden's aesthetics 
              and functionality. Started the project in July 2024 and worked on it during free time and some weekends. Its soon to be done!
